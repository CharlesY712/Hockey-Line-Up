#### Order Of Attack

1) Fetch from API and clean data, lint, write tests.

2) Build React Architecture, lint, write tests.

3) Build and connect Redux Store, lint, write tests.

4) Display data on page, lint, write tests.

5) Style page, lint, write tests.

#### MVP

A three page site displaying games for the day, week, month.

#### Nice To Haves

Click on a game from any page to get in-depth information about that game.

Live score updates for games in progress.

User can save a favorite team. Have site colors match favorite team colors?

User can select a time-zone so that games-times are accurate.

#### Biggest Challenges

The size of the data is immense and will need lots of filtering.

If live updates are implemented, setting a timer for fetch calls.
